## Description

Very low effort amalgam of several Source Han Sans-derived fonts with some minute edits.

It is recommended that [Lorchin Sans](https://github.com/Losketch/LorchinSans) should be used as a fallback font, if sans/gothic style for CJK ideographs is mandatory.

Glyphs do not necessarily follow any source, but most of them should follow either G-source or K-source (as a result of combining G-source Plangothic and K-source (not exactly V-source) Gothic Nguyen.

I plan to convert all glyphs to `K→J→S→V→H→M→T→U→G→P` source, roughly in this fallback order where applicable, but this will probably never happen.

Scriptwide Sans CJK consists of 3 fonts to support as many CJK ideographs as possible.

Additionally, Scriptwide Sans CJK covers all of tentative CJK Ext-J thanks to Plangothic, but official Unicode mappings may change.
