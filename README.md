## Description

Very low effort amalgam of several Source Han Sans-derived fonts with some minute edits.

Glyphs do not necessarily follow any source, but most of them should follow either G-source or K-source (as a result of combining G-source Plangothic and K-source (not exactly V-source) Gothic Nguyen.

I plan to convert all glyphs to `K→J→S→H→M→T→V→U→G→P` source, in this fallback order, but this will probably never happen.

Scriptwide Sans CJK consists of 3 fonts to support as many CJK ideographs as possible.

## Coverage

Additionally, Scriptwide Sans CJK covers all of tentative CJK Ext-J thanks to Plangothic, but official Unicode mappings may change.
