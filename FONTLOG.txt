FONTLOG for the Scriptwide Sans CJK font

This FONTLOG is adopted from Appendix A of <https://openfontlicense.org/ofl-faq/>.

This file provides detailed information on the Scriptwide Sans CJK Font Software.  

Basic Font Information

Scriptwide Sans CJK is a font aiming to support all CJK (Han characters used in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and also Vietnamese and Zhuang etc.) characters.
Due to its size, the font is split into three font files: CJK-A, CJK-B, and CJK-C.

Only a bold version of CJK-A is currently provided. Supplementary bold characters are included in CJK-BdPlus.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges (for brevity, only CJK Unified Ideographs and CJK Compatibility Ideographs blocks are provided):

[CJK-A]
CJK Unified Ideographs
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A
CJK Compatibility Ideographs
Private Use Area (U+E000 - U+E008)

[CJK-B]
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B

[CJK-C]
CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension H
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension I
CJK Unified Ideographs Extension J (Provisional)

This release contains three regular fonts (CJK-A, CJK-B, CJK-C). Two bold fonts (CJK-A-Bd, CJK-BdPlus) are also provided.
